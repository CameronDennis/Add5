# Add5
add5 is a program that can take in a total of 5 single digit numbers and add them together. As it takes in the numbers, it prints them, and then after either a total of 5 numbers is entered or enter is pressed, the sum is shown. If q is pressed at any time during the program, it will halt and thank you for playing. 


To run this program, download the files add5.asm, lc3os.asm, and PennSim.jar into their own directory (folder). Run PennSim. 
In the top text box beneath the buttons "Next, Continue...", enter the following commands:

`as lc3os.asm`

`as add5.asm`

`ld lc3os.obj`

`ld add5.obj`

After you've entered these commands, press the continue button at the top, then click inside of the white box under the large black box on the bottom left. This is the interface for sending text to the program. You may then interact with the program.
